# CVE-2022-42475

## Redacted Version
This version of the exploit will not work without you, the hacker, supplying the necessary memory addresses for ROP gadgets, etc. The work to determine these data is confidential and proprietary to Bishop Fox and I will not (cannot) publish it alongside this exploit. I trust you understand!

## Modes of operation
* Validate only, no exploit. Determines if vulnerable. No payload, no shellcode.
* __Exploit, but verify only__. Run benign connect-back "ping" shellcode to verify the target is exploitable.
* __Exploit with connect-back binary stager__. The shellcode connects back to the exploit, downloads an encrypted operator-supplied binary file (typically [https://gitub.com/BishopFox/Sliver](Sliver)), decrypts the binary, then calls `execve(binary_file)`.

**Note**: At present the "validate only" mode works across all known versions of FortiOS. However, exploits work _only_ against FortiOS 6.0.4 on 100D hardware. I no longer work at BF and therefore cannot publish the expanded exploit that supports something like 18k targets.

## Requirements
* PyCrypto
* pycryptodome

```
pip3 install PyCrypto
pip3 install pycryptodome
```

## Validate only
This will not make any attempt to exploit the bug, but instead triggers it as a crash (the remote SSL VPN daemon restarts automatically and immediately). The crash is detected heuristically and reported to the operator.

Run it using the `-v` validate flag:

```
$ ./x.py -t 192.168.0.10 -p 8443 -v

    --[ CVE-2022-42475: FortiGate Remote Pre-auth RCE ]--
    --[ Bishop Fox Cosmos Team X                      ]--

[+] Running in validate-only mode. No RCE.
[>] Testing to see if target is vulnerable (may take 10 seconds)
[+] Target '192.168.0.10:8443' appears to be VULNERABLE
```

## Exploit, but validate (feature only available for FortiOS 6.0.4 on 100D appliances at present)
This will trigger the bug, deploy a ROP chain, and jump to shellcode. The shellcode is benign and works as follows:

* Exploit connects to target and triggers the vuln to execute shellcode
* Shellcode connects back to operator's IP:port
* Shellcode sends a single "hello" byte to the exploit: `0xbf`
* Exploit delivers a small encrypted test payload to the shellcode (AES key is random each run)
* Shellcode decrypts the payload and saves it to `/tmp/x` on the FortiGate appliance
* Shellcode sends another single `0xbf` byte to the exploit if payload decryption was successful
* Exploit reads the byte and confirms code execution.

Flags:
```
-t           target host/IP
-p           target port
-e           exploit mode
-c           connect-back only mode
-H and -P    operator's IP:port  (required)
-s           software version of FortiOS (required)
-m           hardware model running FortiOS

An example where we select both software version `6.0.4` and the appliance model `100D`:

If you omit the `-m` to choose a hardware model, the exploit will brute-force all hardware targets for the specified software version.

## Global thermonuclear warfare
* Operator specifies the location of a Sliver implant binary (Linux-based)
* Exploit connects to target and triggers the vuln to execute shellcode
* Shellcode connects back to operator's IP:port
* Shellcode sends a single "hello" byte to the exploit: `0xbf`
* Exploit encrypts Sliver binary and sends it to the shellcode
* Shellcode decrypts the binary and saves it to `/tmp/x`
* Shellcode sends a "success" `0xbf` byte to the exploit
* Exploit reads the byte and confirms code execution
* Shellcode calls `execve("/tmp/x")`
* ???
* Profit!

Note that Sliver returns `<err>` because FortiOS is kinda mostly sorta Linux, and doesn't always work the way that you'd expect. This is an issue with FortiOS, not Sliver.

## More versions coming soon
I no longer work at Bishop Fox so you'll need to follow the BF github for updates on this.
